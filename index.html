              <p> Healing crystals are believed to be stones or crystals that 
                possess spiritual and healing properties. Users of healing crystals
                 believe that they can promote physical and emotional healing by 
                 balancing and channeling energy in the body.
                <br> The ethics of advertising healing crystals online with 
                promises of good fortune, aid for mental health, and aid for sleep
                 can be debated. On one hand, users may be aware what crystals can and can not do
                 while others have full faith in their healing abilities.
                 Others argue that these stones can have a positive impact on one's well-being, 
                 and that advertising them can help others learn about their 
                 potential benefits. On the other hand, skeptics argue that the 
                 use of healing crystals lacks scientific evidence and can give 
                 people false hope or prevent them from seeking necessary medical 
                 treatment.

                    1. They have personal experiences and anecdotal evidence of positive effects from using healing crystals, and believe that their benefits are based on metaphysical properties that go beyond the scientific realm.<br/>
                    2. Healing crystals are used as a complementary approach, and are not intended to replace conventional medical care. They argue that people have the right to choose and explore different modalities for their well-being, and that healing crystals can provide comfort and support in conjunction with other forms of treatment. <br/>
                    3. Online advertising of healing crystals with promises of specific outcomes is a form of freedom of expression, and that individuals should have the right to share their beliefs and experiences with others.

                    The arguments for and against the use of healing crystals largely revolve around the lack of scientific evidence. 
                    Skeptics argue that the use of healing crystals can be harmful if people rely on them instead of seeking necessary medical treatment. Proponents argue that the use of healing crystals can be complementary to traditional medical treatment and can promote overall well-being.

                    Skeptics and critics of healing crystals argue that: <br/>
                    1. Healing crystals lack scientific evidence to support their claimed healing properties, and that any perceived benefits may be due to placebo effects or subjective experiences. <br/>
                    2. Advertising healing crystals online with promises of specific outcomes, such as good fortune or mental health benefits, can be misleading and unethical, as it creates false hope and reliance on unproven treatments.<br/>
                    3. Promoting pseudoscience can be harmful, as it can discourage people from seeking appropriate medical care for serious health conditions, and may delay or prevent them from receiving evidence-based treatments that are supported by scientific research.

               <b>Cigarette advertising</b> 
               <div class="description">
                Cigarette advertisements have a long history of using appeals to authority and to peoples concerns over their health. Viceroy cigarettes would become well known for this tactic in the late 1940s to the early 1950s where they advertised their filters that allowed for a healthy and dentist approved cigarette. Was this ethical to promote cigarettes this way?

<br/> At this point in time the issue of smoking causing cancer and other ailments was in early development. The idea of smoking was glamorized and would continue to be for years. At the time this ad could have been seen as a truthful attempt to sell healthier cigarettes although the use of theoretical dentists would be unethical in promoting their product.

        <div class="description">
            <p> The ethics of the magic gas pill would depend on the severity of the claims made by the company. If the product can truly improve fuel economy, reduce emissions, and provide other benefits without posing any harm to the environment or consumers, then it may be considered ethical to market and sell it. <br/>
                So, does it work? No. <br/>
                The claims are unsubstantiated and false, and widely recommended to not be put directly in your gas tank,making it unethical to market and sell.
                 It is important for companies to provide accurate and truthful information about their products to consumers, and to ensure that their products are safe and effective before making any claims. <br/>
                In the case of BioPerformance, the company was sued by the Attorney General of Texas for making bogus claims, running an illegal pyramid scheme, and potentially containing toxic materials. 
                Auto expert Tom Hargrave also found red flags on the company's website and concluded that the pills weren't much more than mothballs. 
                This situation emphasizes how it is essential to conduct thorough research and testing 
                to ensure that any product is safe, effective, and truthful before making any claims and selling it to consumers.
                <br/>NOTE: The gasoline pill was popularized in science fiction and most popularly known for being a creation by Grandpa Munster in an episode of The Munsters.

                <p> Most notably the tharnos scam was advertised in pharmacies.
                    The ethics of pseudoscience advertising in medical-related 
                    stores are questionable, especially in light of cases like 
                    Theranos. The problem stems from the fact that investors, 
                    many of whom have little to no scientific background, are 
                    investing in healthcare startups, often without any research 
                    or evidence to back up the claims being made. Furthermore, the 
                    Silicon Valley tech ethos of "move fast and break things" is not 
                    being counterbalanced by the healthcare principal of "do no harm." 
                    This can lead to real people being in danger.
                   Additionally, charismatic founders can be highly persuasive, leading them to overlook the risks associated with a particular 
                   healthcare startup. To allow for a future of ethical healthcare, startups need to be 
                   regulated and heavily tested before they cause harm to real people.

                    The Associated Press conducted an investigation that found that 
                    the anti-vaccination movement has become a profitable disinformation
                     industry that spreads fear and distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. 
                     The investigation discovered that Ty and Charlene Bollinger, 
                     who lead this movement, collaborate with other prominent anti-vaccination activists, 
                     such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his Children's Health Defense, 
                     to market their vaccine video series, The Truth About Vaccines 2020. 
                     The couple's business, which began with books and DVDs promoting cancer prevention and alternative treatments, has grown to include disinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines. 
                     The Bollingers and others have gained followers on social media and aligned themselves with right-wing supporters of former President Donald Trump. 
                     This situation is one of the more clear cases of unethical pseudoscience that was motivated by greed and pushed on people through social media.
                    <br/>
                     The investigation found that advocates made money from marketing 
                     materials by using "affiliate marketing" links, which generate a
                      commission on sales. <br/>
                      While some of the profits generated from these ventures have 
                      been declared, the scale of the financial connections remains 
                      largely unknown to their audience, who are often simply 
                      looking for information but are exposed to disinformation.

                    Apollo Neuro is a new company with an emphasis on being the leading technology in anti-anxiety technology. <br/>
                    The ethics of selling anti-anxiety tools and wearable devices that claim to provide therapeutic benefits is a complex issue. On the one hand, these tools may be helpful for some people in managing their anxiety symptoms. However, on the other hand, the claims made by some of these devices may be exaggerated, and the lack of research and regulation in the industry raises ethical concerns. <br/>
                    One of the primary ethical concerns is the potential for these devices to be marketed as a substitute for evidence-based mental health treatments, such as therapy or medication. While these tools may be helpful as a supplement to traditional treatment, they should not be marketed as a replacement for professional mental health care.

                    Another concern is the potential for these devices to give false hope to people with severe anxiety or mental health disorders. While these tools may provide temporary relief, they may not be effective in treating the underlying causes of anxiety, and their use may delay seeking professional help. <br/>    
                    Additionally, the lack of regulation in the industry raises ethical concerns. The claims made by some of these devices may be exaggerated, and there may not be sufficient evidence to support their effectiveness. As a result, people may be misled into purchasing a product that does not actually provide the benefits it claims to. <br/>
                    The ethics of a psychiatrist inventing and backing one of these tools, such as Dr. Dave Rabin with the Apollo Neuro, are also worth considering. While a psychiatrist may have expertise in mental health, the creation and promotion of a commercial product raises questions about conflicts of interest and the potential for financial gain to influence professional judgment. <br/>

                    Virtual reality therapy is seen as a promising new treatment for 
                    anxiety and phobias, but it is still in the early stages of

                    <br/>
                     Of course, some devices are being marketed as virtual reality therapy devices, 
                     but they may not be backed up by scientific evidence and may not be effective.
